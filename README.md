## Predicting the outcomes of patients.

This repo contains the data and files of a research project to predict the outcomes of patients using seven days of medical test results.  In order to keep the data fully anonymized, the type of medical condition that is being evaluated will not be mentioned.  

The goal of this project is to create an R Shiny dashboard for medical professionals so that they can input these test results and see the likelihood that the patient will need further treatment.  Our research may also lead to recommendations for how to better collect this data, resulting in better treatment of these types of patients.

The models and Shiny app are currently being developed by Dr. Chris Morano under the supervision and guidance of Dr. Giulio Dalla Riva (https://github.com/gvdr).

The dependencies for this project are: `R`, `tidyverse`, `caret`, `randomForest`, `lime`, and `Shiny`.
